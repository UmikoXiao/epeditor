# epeditor: Batch Parameter-Tuning, Simulation & Result-Reading for EnergyPlus

This in-house module is built on top of [eppy](https://eppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Main_Tutorial.html) 
and [db_eplusout_reader](https://github.com/DesignBuilderSoftware/db-eplusout-reader).  
It provides the research group with the following main features:

1. Automatically reads an `.idf` baseline file and matches the corresponding `.idd` for its version.
2. Fully compatible with all eppy functions, allowing basic parameter modification of the baseline.
3. Creates batch editors by keyword search or by eppy's `idfobjects` method.
4. Applies editors to generate version-specific `.idf` files in bulk.
5. Runs parallel batch simulations locally (cloud option not yet implemented) and archives results.
6. Leverages all functions of `db_eplusout_reader` for horizontal & vertical statistics across cases.
7. Uploads simulation results to the group's database (not yet implemented).
